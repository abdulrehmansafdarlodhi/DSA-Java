[Music] [Laughter] [Music] all the praise is for Allah who is the author of all existence and the most generous to his creation while he is also the all [Music] compelling he is the only one worthy of our worship having no Partners no Associates no Sons no daughters no one whom he must consult and no one or anything which has any comparison with him all the praise is for Allah who is the king of all who claim sovereignty the only one one who has the right to legislate for his creatures he is The Giver of Life he is the causer of death while death has no effect upon him because he is the everliving the self subsisting the Eternal and the only absolute all the praise is for Allah who has power over all things and there is in reality no power and no strength no influence to cause benefit or detriment except through [Music] him it is he who created this complex world the seen and the Unseen the evident and the speculative the Earth and all that is on it and everything that is in it it is he who sent his Messengers and Prophets with the common message of strict monotheism which simply means that there's absolutely no one worthy of worship no one worthy of our obedience except the almighty the one the absolute and who has no Partners the earlier messages which changed the world in the area in which the prophets were sent those messages we know have changed and even the prophets who brought them their names are now lost we just know in general because Allah told us in the Quran I've sent to every nation a messenger calling people to worship Allah alone and to avoid the worship of false gods this essential message has been preserved in Islam in a way that it was never preserved before not because the message was different because it was the same message but because of the fact that there would be no other prophet phets who would come after Muhammad sallahu alhi wasallam so therefore that message now had to be protected it had to be preserved in a way none of the earlier messages were preserved were preserved I will Rel this what you say you have come to know 40 years back and what you call the big bang is already mentioned mentioned in the book which I read the Glorious Quran it's mentioned 14400 years ago in Sur chapter number 21 verse number 30 which says do not the unbeliever see that the Heaven and the Earth were joined together and we clo them aund what you're talking about the big bang I try to imagine compressing a spring I push it closer and closer and closer together so it's smaller and smaller and smaller and I've stored a tremendous amount of energy in that spring and want to let it go it bursts out it bursts out it bursts out the creation of the universe which you came to know 40 years back is already mentioned in this book The Glorious Quran 1,400 years ago who could have mentioned that in the Quran so theist will say maybe someone WR maybe it's a FL maybe it's a guess workor a human being regardless of who they are or where they are or what they do will have this curiosity they'll want to know why am I here how did I get here and do I have a purpose and if so what is it the only one who would really be able to answer that question would be the Creator himself if there is a Creator it would be up to him to tell us why we were created and what he expects from us and what this life is really about Allah has shown the people from the time of Adam until right now has shown the people what he wants from them and it's a very simple thing and that is that worship be for him alone without any Partners in fact we know this life to be a test from almighty God that's why we're born and that's why we die because there has to be a beginning and an end for us to be tested on the next life after this life no one will ever die again a bad person or a good person both are brought back and they continue to live in the next life either in good shape or not so good shape depending on how they did on the test the worship of the god of Abraham that was what was taught by these Prophets The Lord of the we're talking about the lord of the Worlds alhamd we're talking about the lord of the entire universe and Beyond the entire universe and Beyond you know we live in this dun and we are fascinated with this Dunya which Allah subhana wa ta'ala indeed has created in a beautiful manner we're fascinated there are over billions of people which live on this dun at this moment in time over six billion people that live on the Dunya at this moment in time this dun of Allah subhana wa ta'ala is so big that there is space in this dun for billions and billions and billions or more people but what is this dun in comparison to what Allah subhana wa tala has created out there this dun is insignificant this dya is meaningless to Allah it means nothing it is worthless so worthless compare it with the sun the sun is one star you know more science than me you'll be able to tell me better take this planet Earth and you place it inside the Sun and you will be able able to place 1.3 million Earths in the sun 1.3 million Earth in the sun Allah abbar Allah is the greatest the sun is one star one star there are stars out there which are millions of times bigger than the Sun you need you tell me this that you need Millions and millions of stars to make one Galaxy and then you tell me this that there are zillions of galaxies out there let me tell you on top of this my friend after this whatever you see above whatever you see above when you raise your head and you look above whatever you see above the zillions and zillions and z billions of galaxies let me tell you this is everything there is within the first Heaven everything there is within the first heaven and Allah is the creator of seven Heavens seven heavens and the distance between the first Heaven and the second heaven is 500 years you know the distance that can be covered in 500 years at what speed only Allah knows only Allah knows but it will take 500 years to get from the first heaven to the second heaven 500 years from the second to the third third to the fourth four to the Fifth Fifth to the sixth sixth to the seventh every time it will take 500 years after the seven [Laughter] heavens you all read the you all know the ayat after this you have the of Allah you have the chair of Allah subhana wa ta'ala you know these seven Heavens that we've just talked about in comparison to the of Allah they're nonexistent they're meaningless wasallam has given an example in aith just to give us a little bit of understanding with regards to the seven Heavens in comparison to the of Allah take a ring from your finger take it off the small ring that you have and place it let's say in a desert the Sahara Desert it's the biggest desert in the world you know that ring that we take off from our fingers and place it in the Sahara Desert what sign what comparison is in between the ring and the Sahara Desert nothing nothing nothing nothing the seven Heavens is the ring and the of Allah is the Sahara Desert after the of Allah you have the you have the of Allah again has given has explained so just so that we can understand take the ring place it in the desert this time time the ring is the and the AR is the desert what is the in comparison to the AR of Allah nothing then you have Angels which carry the AR of Allah their heads are in the seventh heaven and their feet are in the lowest Earth my friends then you have the lord of the Earth he is beyond the size of Allah who Allah is what Allah is the greatness of Allah is beyond the comprehension of my little mind this is the being that you and I are messing with [Music] for [Music] for
